NAME
    Type::Tiny::XS - provides an XS boost for some of Type::Tiny's built-in
    type constraints

SYNOPSIS
       use Types::Standard qw(Int);

DESCRIPTION
    This module is optionally used by Type::Tiny 0.045_03 and above to provide
    faster, C-based implementations of some type constraints. (This package
    has only core dependencies, and does not depend on Type::Tiny, so other
    data validation frameworks might also consider using it!)

    Only the following two functions should be considered part of the
    supported API:

    `Type::Tiny::XS::get_coderef_for($type)`
        Given a supported type constraint name, such as "Int", returns a
        coderef that can be used to validate a parameter against this
        constraint.

        Returns undef if this module cannot provide a suitable coderef.

    `Type::Tiny::XS::get_subname_for($type)`
        Like `get_coderef_for` but returns the name of such a sub as a string.

        Returns undef if this module cannot provide a suitable sub name.

    `Type::Tiny::XS::is_known($coderef)`
        Returns true if the coderef was provided by Type::Tiny::XS.

    In addition to the above functions, the subs returned by `get_coderef_for`
    and `get_subname_for` are considered part of the "supported API", but only
    for the lifetime of the Perl process that returned them.

    To clarify, if you call `get_subname_for("ArrayRef[Int]")` in a script,
    this will return the name of a sub. That sub (which can be used to
    validate arrayrefs of integers) is now considered part of the supported
    API of Type::Tiny::XS until the script finishes running. Next time the
    script runs, there is no guarantee that the sub will continue to exist, or
    continue to do the same thing.
