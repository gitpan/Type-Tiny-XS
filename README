NAME
    Type::Tiny::XS - provides an XS boost for some of Type::Tiny's built-in
    type constraints

SYNOPSIS
       use Types::Standard qw(Int);

DESCRIPTION
    Current releases of Type::Tiny do not make use of Type::Tiny::XS. This
    distribution is just an experimental space for making stuff faster.

    Only the following two functions should be considered part of the
    supported API:

    `Type::Tiny::XS::get_coderef_for($type)`
        Given a supported type constraint name, such as "Int", returns a
        coderef that can be used to validate a parameter against this
        constraint.

    `Type::Tiny::XS::get_subname_for($type)`
        Like `get_coderef_for` but returns the name of such a sub as a string.
